# [LOG ENTRY TEMPLATE]
# [TIME]: [ERROR/CHALLENGE]
# [RESOLUTION]: [What I did to fix it, and the concept it taught me]
#

# [DEC 2, 2025]: ARCHITECTURAL PIVOT - COST OPTIMIZATION
# CHALLENGE:
# AWS Route 53 costs $0.50/month per hosted zone. I want to maintain a strict $0.00 budget
# to demonstrate absolute cost-efficiency for small-scale projects.
#
# RESOLUTION:
# I decided to bypass Route 53. Instead of using an AWS Hosted Zone, I will use Namecheap's
# default DNS servers and create a CNAME record that points directly to the CloudFront distribution.
# This keeps the project completely free while still allowing a custom domain.

# [DEC 2, 2025]: DOMAIN PROVISIONING
# ACTION:
# Claimed free domain via GitHub Student Developer Pack.
# Provider: name.com
# Domain Name: sanaetcloud.engineer
# Cost: $0.00
# Status: Active
