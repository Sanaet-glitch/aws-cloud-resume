# CLOUD RESUME CHALLENGE - DEVELOPMENT LOG
########################################
#
# Purpose: This is a private working document to track challenges, errors, and fixes.
# This log will be summarized into the 'Challenges & Learnings' section of the final README.md.
#
# Date: Dec 2, 2025
# Goal: Set up static hosting (S3 + CloudFront).
#

# [LOG ENTRY TEMPLATE]
# [TIME]: [ERROR/CHALLENGE]
# [RESOLUTION]: [What I did to fix it, and the concept it taught me]
#

# [DEC 2, 2025]: ARCHITECTURAL PIVOT - COST OPTIMIZATION
# CHALLENGE:
# AWS Route 53 costs $0.50/month per hosted zone. I want to maintain a strict $0.00 budget
# to demonstrate absolute cost-efficiency for small-scale projects.
#
# RESOLUTION:
# I decided to bypass Route 53. Instead of using an AWS Hosted Zone, I will use Namecheap's
# default DNS servers and create a CNAME record that points directly to the CloudFront distribution.
# This keeps the project completely free while still allowing a custom domain.

# [DEC 2, 2025]: DOMAIN PROVISIONING
# ACTION:
# Claimed free domain via GitHub Student Developer Pack.
# Provider: name.com
# Domain Name: sanaetcloud.engineer
# Cost: $0.00
# Status: Active

# [DEC 2, 2025]: AWS INFRASTRUCTURE INITIALIZATION
# ACTION 1: ACCOUNT SETUP
# - Created standard AWS Free Tier account.
# - Verified identity via phone and card.
#
# ACTION 2: COST SAFETY (CRITICAL)
# - Enabled "Receive Free Tier Usage Alerts" in Billing Preferences.
# - Created CloudWatch Billing Alarm:
#   - Metric: EstimatedCharges
#   - Threshold: >= $1.00 USD
#   - Notification: Email sent to my personal address.
#   - Status: Subscription confirmed via email.
#
# ACTION 3: SECURITY HARDENING (IAM)
# - Secured Root User with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
# - Created an IAM User Group with 'AdministratorAccess' policy.
# - Created an IAM User and added them to the IAM User group.
#
# STATUS:
# Root user locked away. Logged in as the IAM User for every day activities.

# [DEC 2, 2025]: S3 DEPLOYMENT (CONSOLE FALLBACK)
# ACTION:
# Deployed S3 bucket 'sanaetcloud.engineer' in us-east-1.
# - Enabled Static Website Hosting.
# - Configured Public Read Bucket Policy.
# - Uploaded index.html.
#
# CHALLENGE:
# AWS CloudShell was blocked due to "Account Verification" status (new account).
# RESOLUTION:
# Pivoted to using the AWS Management Console (GUI) to execute the deployment.
#
# VERIFICATION:
# Website is live at the S3 endpoint URL.

# [DEC 2, 2025]: SSL CERTIFICATE PROVISIONING (ACM)
# ACTION:
# Requested public SSL/TLS certificate via AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) in us-east-1.
# - Domains covered: sanaetcloud.engineer, www.sanaetcloud.engineer.
# - Validation Method: DNS Validation.
#
# IMPLEMENTATION:
# Extracted CNAME records from AWS ACM.
# Added CNAME records to Name.com DNS configuration.
#
# VERIFICATION:
# Certificate status changed from 'Pending validation' to 'Issued'.
# We now have a valid SSL certificate ready for attachment.
